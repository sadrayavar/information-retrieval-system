The stories video games tell are becoming richer and more nuanced. They can explore complex themes like morality,
sacrifice, and redemption, or simply provide a lighthearted escape filled with humor and adventure. Many games allow
players to shape the narrative through their choices, creating a sense of agency and immersion. With voice acting that
breathes life into characters, motion capture that conveys every subtle emotion, and stunning visuals that rival
Hollywood blockbusters, the lines between games and movies are blurring, creating truly cinematic experiences.

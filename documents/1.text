Video games have come a long way since their pixelated beginnings. From simple arcade games with a single goal and a
handful of controls to sprawling open worlds teeming with life and countless activities, they offer a diverse playground
for imagination. Players can become warriors slaying dragons in medieval fantasy epics, astronauts exploring distant
galaxies in sprawling space operas, or architects crafting their dream cities in simulation games. The rise of esports
has even turned gaming into a spectator sport, with professional players captivating audiences from around the world
with their strategic prowess and lightning-fast reflexes.  These competitive matches can be as thrilling to watch as
traditional sporting events, and they have turned video games into a major cultural phenomenon.
